        <h1>I will persist without exception.</h1>
        <p>Knowing that I have already made changes in my life that will last forever, today I insert the final piece of the puzzle. I possess the greatest power ever bestowed upon mankind, the power of choice. Today, I choose to persist without exception. No longer will I live in a dimension od distraction, my focus blown hither and yon like a lead on a blustery day. I know the outcome i desire I hold fast to my dreams. I stay the course. I do not quit.</p>
        <p>I will persist without exception. I will continue despite exhaustion.</p>
        <p>I acknowledge that most people quit when exhaustion sets in. I am not "most people." I am stronger than most people. Average people accept exhaustion as a matter of course. I do not. Average people compare themselves with other people. That is why they are average. I compare myself to my potential. I am not average. I see exhaustion as a precursor to victory.</p>
        <p>How long must a child try to walk before he actually does so? Do I not have more strength than a child? More understanding? More desire? How long must I work to succeed before I actually do so? A child would never ask the question, for the answer does not matter. By persisting without exception, my outcome&mdash;my success&mdash;is assured.</p>
        <p>I will persist without exception. I focus on results.</p>
        <p>To achieve the results I desire, it is not even necessary that I enjoy the process. It is only important that I <em>continue</em> the process with my eyes on the outcome. An athlete does not enjoy the pain of training; an athlete enjoys the results of having trained. A young falcon is pushed from the nest, afraid and tumbling from the cliff. The pain of learning to fly cannot be an enjoyable experience, but the anguish of learning to fly is quickly forgotten as the falcon soars to the heavens.</p>
        <p>A sailor who fearfully watches stormy seas lash his vessel will always steer an unproductive course. But a wise and experienced captain keeps his eye firmly fixed upon the lighthouse. He knows that by guiding his ship directly to a specific point, the time spent in discomfort is lessened. And by keeping his eye on the light, there never exists one second of discouragement. My light, my harbor, my future is within sight!</p>
        <p>I will persist without exception. I am a person of great faith.</p>
        <p>In Jeremiah, my Creator declares, "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." From this day forward, I will claim a faith in the certainty of my future. Too much of my life has been spent doubting my beliefs and believing my doubts. No more! I have faith in my future. I do not look left or right. I look forward. I can only persist.</p>
        <p>For me, faith will always be a sounder guide than reason because reason can only go so far&mdash;faith has no limits. I will expect miracles in my life because faith produces them every day. I will believe in the future that I do not see. That is faith. And the reward of this faith is to see the future that I believed.</p>
        <p>I will continue despite exhaustion. I focus on results. I am a person of great faith.</p>
        <p>I will persist without exception.</p>
