        <h1>I will seek wisdom.</h1>
        <p>Knowing that wisdom waits to be gathered, I will actively search her out. My past can never be changed, but I can change the future by changing my actions today. I <em>will</em> change my actions today! I will train my eyes and ears to read and listen to books and recordings that bring about positive changes in my personal relationships and a greater understanding of my fellowman. No longer will I bombard my mind with materials that feed my doubts and fears. I will read and listen only to what increases my belief in myself and my future.</p>
        <p>I will seek wisdom. I will choose my friends with care.</p>
        <p>I am who my friends are. I speak their language, and I wear their clothes. I share their opinions and their habits. From this moment forward, I will choose to associate with people whose lives and lifestyles I admire. If I associate with chickens, I will learn to scratch at the ground and squabble over crumbs. If I associate with eagles, I will learn to soar to great heights. I am an eagle. It is my destiny to fly.</p>
        <p>I will seek wisdom. I will listen to the counsel of wise men.</p>
        <p>The words of a wise man are like raindrops on dry ground. They are precious and can be quickly used for immediate results. Only the blade of grass that catches a raindrop will prosper and grow. The person who ignores wise counsel is like the blade of grass untouched by the rain&mdash;soon to wither and die. When I counsel with just myself, I can make decisions only according to what I already know. By counseling with a wise man, I add his knowledge and experience to my own and dramatically increase my success.</p>
        <p>I will seek wisdom. I will be a servant to others.</p>
        <p>A wise man will cultivate a servant's spirit, for that particular attribute attracts people like no other. As I humbly serve others, their wisdom will be freely shared with me. Often, the person who develops a servant's spirit becomes wealthy beyond measure. Many times, a servant has the ear of the king, and a humble servant often becomes a king, for he is the popular choice of the people. He who serves the most grows the fastest.</p>
        <p>I will become a humble servant. I will not look for someone to open my door&mdash;I will look to open the door for someone. I will not be distressed when no one is available to help me&mdash;I will be excited when I am available to help.</p>
        <p>I will be a servant to others. I will listen to the counsel of wise men. I will choose my friends with care.</p>
        <p>I will seek wisdom.</p>
