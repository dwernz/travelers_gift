        <h1>The buck stops here.</h1>
        <p>From this moment forward, I will accept responsibility for my past. I understand that the beginning of wisdom is to accept the responsibilities for my own problems and that by accepting responsibility for my past, I free myself to move into a bigger, brighter future of my own choosing.</p>
        <p>Never again will I blame my parents, my spouse, my boss, or other employees for my present situation. Neither my education nor lack of one, my genetics, or the circumstantial ebb and flow of everyday life will affect my future in a negative way. If I allow myself to blame these uncontrollable forces for my lack of success, I will be forever caught in a web of the past. I will look forward. I will not let my history control my destiny.</p>
        <p>The buck stops here. I accept responsibility for my past. I am responsible for my success.</p>
        <p>I am where I am today&mdash;mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, and financially&mdash;because of decisions I have made. My decisions have always been governed by my thinking. Therefore, I am where I am today&mdash;mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, and financially&mdash;because of how I think. Today I will begin the process of changing where I am&mdash;mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, and financially&mdash;by changing the way I think.</p>
        <p>My thoughts will be constructive, never destructive. My mind will live in the solutions of the future. It will not dwell in the problems of the past. I will seek the association of those who are working and striving to bring about positive changes in the world. I will never seek comfort by associating with those who have decided to be comfortable.</p>
        <p>When faced with the opportunity to make a decision, I will make one. I understand that God did not put in me the ability to always make right decisions. He did, however, put in me the ability to <em>make</em> a decision and then <em>make it right.</em> The rise and fall of my emotional tide will not deter me from my course. When I make a decision, I will stand behind it. My energy will go into making the decision. I will waste none on second thoughts. My life will not be an apology. It will be a statement.</p>
        <p>The buck stops here. I control my thoughts. I control my emotions.</p>
        <p>In the future when I am tempted to ask the question "Why me?" I will immediately counter with the answer: "Why <em>not</em> me?" Challenges are gifts, opportunities to learn. Problems are the common thread running through the lives of great men and women. In times of adversity, I will not have a problem to deal with; I will have a choice to make. My thoughts will be clear. I will make the right choice. Adversity is preparation for greatness. I will accept this preparation. Why me? Why <em>not</em> me> I will be prepared for something great!</p>
        <p>I accept responsibility for my past. I control my thoughts. I control my emotions. I am responsible for my success.</p>
        <p>The buck stops here.</p>
